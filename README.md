# SassyPher

A Sass cryptography experiment: trying to implement simple ciphers
and related paradigms in pure Sass (no Ruby).

Nothing to do with CSS here (unless you need to encrypt your stylesheets...),
so use cases are close to zero.

But some interesting goals:

* Have fun coding
* Learn more about cryptography
* Practice and deepen knowledge about some programming concepts
* Try to push Sass limits further and draw the line
between what would make sense to implement in Sass or not.
What would be releveant to add to the language and what not.
* Did I mentionned have fun ?


## Ciphers

* [Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
* Caesar keyed
* ROT5
* [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)
* ROT18
* ROT47
* [Vigenère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)
* Vigenère keyed
* [Vigenère autokey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autokey_cipher)
* [One-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad)
* [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher)


## Codes

* [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code)


## Convertions

* [Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code)


## Cryptanalysis
* [Frequency analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis)
* Brute force


## Requirements

* Sass ~> 3.3.8
* SassyBitwise ~> 1.1.2
